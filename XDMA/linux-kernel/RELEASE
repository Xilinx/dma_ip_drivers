v2024.1.0
========
- added support for AlmaOS 9.4 and Ubuntu 24.04

v2020.2.0
=========
- renamed module parameter "enable_credit_mp" to "enable_st_c2h_credit" to 
  accurately describe its usage.
- turn off the ST C2H credit as default (i.e., enable_st_c2h_credit = 0)
- fixed c2h streaming credit issue when data buffers uses >= 1K descriptors.

v2020.1.08
===============
- replaced module parameter "sgdma_timeout" to "h2c_timeout" and "c2h_timeout"
  for H2C and C2H channels.
  value of 0 means no timeout: wait forever for the dma completion.
- added new "-e" option to dma_from_device
  this is for streaming mode only, when -e is set, the driver will end the dma
     and return the data when an EOP (end-of-packet) is received or the
     specified bytes of data is received. 
  without "-e" option, the driver will end the dma when the specified bytes of
     data is received.
- added gen4 device ids
- fixed next adjacent descriptors when dma_alloc_coherent doesn't return a
  page-aligned address

v2020.1.06
===============
- added memory aperture support (-k) option in dma_from_device and dma_to_device.
- fixed holding spinlock while doing wait_event_interruptible_xxx
- kernel 5.0 support
- fixed next adjacent descriptors crossing the 4K boundary

Release: 2019.2
===============

Change list:
- Updated data rate for performance run. Now it will print data rate based on the size.
- remove BUG_ON, return proper error code instead
- Streaming mode: enable credit mechanism by default 
- Streaming mode: Do not read more than user supplied buffer size on C2H
- Streaming mode: Added support for Async-IO for both streaming and MM transfers
- fixed performance appliaction crash
