DMA read and write (dma-rw)
***************************

dma-rw is a user application tool provided along with QDMA Windows driver to demonstrate DMA read and write operations.

usage:

::

	PS H:\> .\dma-rw.exe qdma<N> <DEVNODE> <read|write> <ADDR> [OPTIONS] [DATA]


**Parameters**

::

	- qdma<N>   : unique qdma device name (<N> is BBDDF where BB -> PCI Bus No, DD -> PCI Dev No, F -> PCI Fun No)
	- DEVNODE   : One of: control | user | queue_mm_ | queue_st_*
	              where the * is a numeric wildcard (0 - N) for queue.
	- ADDR      : The target offset address of the read/write operation.
	              Applicable only for control, user, queue_mm device nodes.
	              Can be in hex or decimal.
	- OPTIONS   :
	              -a set alignment requirement for host-side buffer (default: PAGE_SIZE)
	              -b open file as binary
	              -f use contents of file as input or write output into file.
	              -l length of data to read/write (default: 4 bytes or whole file if '-f' flag is used)
	- DATA      : Space separated bytes (big endian) in decimal or hex,
	              e.g.: 17 34 51 68
	              or:   0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44
