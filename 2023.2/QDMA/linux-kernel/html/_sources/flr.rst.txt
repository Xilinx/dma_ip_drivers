*******************************
QDMA Function Level Reset (FLR)
*******************************

QDMA supports Function Level Reset (FLR) to enable the function-level reset from the OS.

- When reset is issues for a VF, only the resources associated with the VF is reseted.
-  When a PF is reset, all resources of the PF, including that of its associated VFs, will be reseted


User can request FLR as follows

::

	[xilinx@]# echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$BDF/reset

Ex:

::

	[xilinx@]# echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.0/reset



The following sequence diagrams shows the reset process for PF and VF.

**NOTE:** FLR is not supported in CentOS because linux kernels provided in CentOS versions does not support the FLR driver call back registration.
