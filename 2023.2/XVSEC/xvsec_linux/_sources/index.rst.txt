========================
Xilinx XVSEC Software
========================

Xilinx Vendor Specific Capabilities(**XVSEC**) are extended features added to
PCI Express configuration space. Some of these capabilities includes
MCAP, ZERO VSEC, etc.,

**Media Configuration Access Port(MCAP)**:
The Media Configuration Access Port (MCAP) is a new configuration interface
available for UltraScale and UltraScale+ devices. This interface is integrated
into the PCI Express hard block and provides access to the FPGA configuration
logic through the PCI Express hard block when enabled.


XVSEC(MCAP) driver can be used with XDMA,
QDMA, AXI-Bridge and BASE Core configurations, but not dependent on any of them.
The use of MCAP or other VSEC is typically independent of the DMA or bridge mode.
In the Future other VSECs may be added by customers.


Xilinx XVSEC Solution consists of

- **User space utility**: XVSEC CLI tool to demonstrate vendor specific features and its functionality

	- This includes MCAP functionality
	- In future, the tool will be expanded with new extended vendor specific capabilities

- **Userspace Library**:

	- This library provides APIs for all Xilinx PCIe Vendor specific capabilities (Ex: MCAP, Generic VSEC, etc.,)

- **Driver Interface**: XVSEC character driver interface per PCIe device

	- XVSEC driver can be loaded independently
	- It is also possible to load XVSEC driver integrated with any other Kernel Driver (Ex: XDMA, QDMA, etc.,)
