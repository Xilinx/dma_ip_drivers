_____________________________________________________________________________


Note: This DPDK driver and applciation were tested on Ubuntu 18.04 machine.


1.) Setup: Download and modifications

The reference driver code requires DPDK version 22.11.
Follow the steps below to download the proper version of DPDK and apply
driver code and test application supplied in the GitHub.

Extract the DPDK driver software database from the Xilinx GitHub to the server where VCU1525
is installed. Henceforth, this area is referred as <dpdk_sw_database>.

Create a directory for the DPDK download on the server where the VCU1525
is installed and move to this directory.

 $ mkdir <server_dir>/<dpdk_test_area>
 $ cd <server_dir>/<dpdk_test_area>
 $ git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk-stable
 $ cd dpdk-stable
 $ git checkout v22.11
 $ git clone git://dpdk.org/dpdk-kmods
 $ cp -r <dpdk_sw_database>/drivers/net/qdma ./drivers/net/
 $ cp -r <dpdk_sw_database>/examples/qdma_testapp ./examples/

	Additionally, make below changes to the DPDK 22.11 tree to build QDMA driver,
	support 4K queues and populate Xilinx devices for binding.

		i. Add QDMA driver
			a. To support 4K queues and 256 PCIe functions, update below configurations	in ./config/rte_config.h
				CONFIG_RTE_MAX_MEMZONE=40960
				CONFIG_RTE_MAX_ETHPORTS=256
				CONFIG_RTE_MAX_QUEUES_PER_PORT=4096

			b. Add below lines to ./config/meson.build in DPDK 22.11 tree
				# Set maximum Ethernet ports to 256
				dpdk_conf.set('RTE_MAX_ETHPORTS', 256)

				# Set maximum VFIO Groups to 256
				dpdk_conf.set('RTE_MAX_VFIO_GROUPS', 256)

			c. Add below lines to ./config/rte_config.h to enable driver debug logs
				#define RTE_LIBRTE_QDMA_DEBUG_DRIVER 1

			d. Add below line to ./drivers/net/meson.build, where PMDs are added to drivers list
				'qdma',

			e. To add Xilinx devices for device binding, add below lines to	./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py after cavium_pkx class, where PCI base class for devices are listed.
				xilinx_qdma_pf = {'Class':  '05', 'Vendor': '10ee', 'Device': '9011,9111,9211,9311,9014,9114,9214,9314,9018,9118,9218,9318,901f,911f,921f,931f,9021,9121,9221,9321,9024,9124,9224,9324,9028,9128,9228,9328,902f,912f,922f,932f,9031,9131,9231,9331,9034,9134,9234,9334,9038,9138,9238,9338,903f,913f,923f,933f,9041,9141,9241,9341,9044,9144,9244,9344,9048,9148,9248,9348,b011,b111,b211,b311,b014,b114,b214,b314,b018,b118,b218,b318,b01f,b11f,b21f,b31f,b021,b121,b221,b321,b024,b124,b224,b324,b028,b128,b228,b328,b02f,b12f,b22f,b32f,b031,b131,b231,b331,b034,b134,b234,b334,b038,b138,b238,b338,b03f,b13f,b23f,b33f,b041,b141,b241,b341,b044,b144,b244,b344,b048,b148,b248,b348',

			d. Update entries in network devices class in ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py to add Xilinx devices
				network_devices = [network_class, cavium_pkx, xilinx_qdma_pf, xilinx_qdma_vf],

2.) Setup: Host system

DPDK requires that hugepages are setup on the server.
The following modifications must be made to the /boot/grub/grub.cfg on the host system

	i. Add hugepages for DPDK
		- Add following parameter to /etc/default/grub file
			GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepagesz=1G hugepages=20"

		This example adds 20 1GB hugepages, which are required to support 2048 queues, with descriptor ring of 1024 entries and each descriptor buffer length of 4KB. The number of hugepages required should be changed if the above configuration (queues, ring size, buffer size) changes.

	ii. Enable IOMMU for VM testing
		- Update /etc/default/grub file as below.
			GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepagesz=1G hugepages=20 iommu=pt intel_iommu=on"

	iii. Execute the following command to modify the /boot/grub/grub.cfg with the configuration set in the above steps and permanently add them to the kernel command line.
		update-grub

	iv. Reboot host system after making the above modifications.

3.) Setup: Build Commands

	i. Compile DPDK & QDMA driver
		a. Execute the following to compile and install the driver.
			cd <server_dir>/<dpdk_test_area>/dpdk-stable
			meson build
			cd build
			ninja
			ninja install
			ldconfig
			
		- The following should appear when ninja completes
			Linking target app/test/dpdk-test.

		- Verify that librte_net_qdma.a is installed in ./build/drivers directory.

	ii. Execute the following to compile the igb_uio kernel driver.
			cd <server_dir>/<dpdk_test_area>/dpdk-stable/dpdk-kmods/linux/igb_uio
			make

	Important Note for VF 4K queue support for CPM5 design only
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    To enable VF 4K queue driver support for CPM5 design, QDMA DPDK driver need
    to compile by enabling the EQDMA_CPM5_VF_GT_256Q_SUPPORTED macro

				cd <server_dir>/<dpdk_test_area>/dpdk-stable
				meson build -DEQDMA_CPM5_VF_GT_256Q_SUPPORTED=1
				cd build
				ninja
				ninja install
				ldconfig

4.) Compile Test application

	i. Change to root user and compile the application
		sudo su
		cd examples/qdma_testapp
		make RTE_SDK=`pwd`/../.. RTE_TARGET=build

	- The following should appear when make completes
			ln -sf qdma_testapp-shared build/qdma_testapp

	ii. Additionally, for memory mapped mode, BRAM size can be configured with make command.
	Default BRAM size is set to 512KB in the driver makefile.


5.) Running the DPDK software test application

The below steps describe the step by step procedure to run the DPDK QDMA test
application and to interact with the QDMA PCIe device.

	i. Navigate to examples/qdma_testapp directory.
		cd <server_dir>/<dpdk_test_area>/dpdk-stable/examples/qdma_testapp

	ii. Run the 'lspci' command on the console and verify that the PFs are detected as shown below. Here, '81' is the PCIe bus number on which Xilinx QDMA device is installed.
		# lspci | grep Xilinx
		81:00.0 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 903f
		81:00.1 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 913f
		81:00.2 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 923f
		81:00.3 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 933f

	iii. Execute the following commands required for running the DPDK application

		# mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge
		# modprobe uio
		# insmod <server_dir>/<dpdk_test_area>/dpdk-stable/dpdk-kmods/linux/igb_uio/igb_uio.ko

	iv. Bind PF ports to the igb_uio module as shown below
		# ../../usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:00.0
		# ../../usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:00.1
		# ../../usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:00.2
		# ../../usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:00.3

	v. The execution of steps iii and iv creates a max_vfs file entry in /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:<bus>:<device>.<function>.

	vi. Enable VFs for each PF by writing the number of VFs to enable to this file as shown below.
		This example creates 1 VF for each PF.
			# echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:81\:00.0/max_vfs
			# echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:81\:00.1/max_vfs
			# echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:81\:00.2/max_vfs
			# echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:81\:00.3/max_vfs

	vii. Run the lspci command on the console and verify that the VFs are listed in the output as shown below
		# lspci | grep Xilinx
		81:00.0 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 903f
		81:00.1 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 913f
		81:00.2 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 923f
		81:00.3 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 933f

		81:10.0 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device a23f
		81:17.4 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device a33f

	viii. Execute the following commands to bind the VF ports to igb_uio module
		# ../../usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:00.4
		# ../../usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:08.4
		# ../../usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:10.0
		# ../../usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:17.4

	ix. Run the qdma_testapp using the following command
		#./build/qdma_testapp -c 0xf -n 4
			- '-c' represents processor mask
			- '-n' represents number of memory channels
