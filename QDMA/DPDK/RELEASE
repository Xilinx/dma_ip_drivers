RELEASE: 2023.1.1
=================

This release is based on DPDK v20.11, v21.11 and v22.11 and
contains QDMA poll mode driver and QDMA test application.

This release is validated for
	- On VCU1525 for QDMA5.0 2022.1 example design
	- On VCU1525 for QDMA4.0 2020.2 example design
	- On VCU1525 for QDMA3.1 2019.2 example design
	- On XCVP1202 for CPM5 2022.1 example design

This release includes patch files for dpdk-pktgen v20.12.0 and v22.04.1 that extends
dpdk-pktgen application to handle packets with packet sizes more than 1518 bytes
and it disables the packet size classification logic in dpdk-pktgen to remove
application overhead in performance measurement.This patch is used for
performance testing with dpdk-pktgen application.

The driver is validated against dpdk-pktgen and testpmd applications for API compliance.

2022.1 Updates
--------------
CPM5
	- FMAP context dump
	- Debug register dump for ST and MM Errors
	- Dual Instance support

2022.1.1 Patch Updates
----------------------
- Added VF 4K queues support for CPM5 design. This feature is applicable only when corresponding RTL support is added.

2022.1.2 Patch Updates
----------------------
- Added support for QDMA5.0 which has some performance optimization changes compared to QDMA4.0

2022.1.3 Patch Updates
----------------------
- Added PF/VF 4K queues support for CPM5 design. This feature is applicable only when corresponding RTL support is added.

2023.1.0 Updates
----------------
- Added support for DPDK framework v21.11 and v22.11 and retained the backward compatibility for v20.11
- Enabled 128 bit SIMD vectorization for Intel and AMD platforms by default for qdma Receive and Transmit APIs
- Added IO memory barriers for H2C/C2H producer index and completion ring consumer index updates

2023.1.1 Updates
----------------
- Optimized the driver code and HW register settings for performance improvements

KNOWN ISSUE:
============
- CPM5:
	- Performance optimizations are not finalized, Updated Performance report with some more optimizations will be available in next patch release.

- All Designs
	- Function Level Reset(FLR) of PF device when VFs are attached to this PF results in mailbox communication failure
	- DPDK C2H and Forwarding performance values for 8 queue is lesser compared to 4 queue case for both PF and VF.


DRIVER LIMITATIONS:
===================
- CPM5 Only
	- VF functionality is verified with 240 VF's as per CPM5 HW limitation

- All Designs
	- Big endian systems are not supported
	- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
	- Current 2023.1.0 driver which is supporting DPDK 22.11/21.11 is not fully verified for stress, multicard, tandem boot and interop use cases. These will be verified and confirmed in next patch release.
