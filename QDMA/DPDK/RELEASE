RELEASE: 2020.2.1
=================

This release is based on DPDK v20.11 and contains QDMA poll mode driver and
QDMA test application.

This release is validated for VCU1525 and U200 devices on QDMA4.0 2020.2 based example design
and QDMA3.1 2020.2 based example design.

This release includes a patch file for dpdk-pktgen v20.12.0 that extends
dpdk-pktgen application to handle packets with packet sizes more than 1518 bytes
and it disables the packet size classification logic in dpdk-pktgen to remove
application overhead in performance measurement.

This patch is used for performance testing with dpdk-pktgen application.
The driver is validated against dpdk-pktgen and testpmd applications for API compliance.

- Split user logic related data path handling code to qdma_user.c and qdma_user.h
- Bug Fixes
	- Correct the PF and VF function ID used in the driver in accordance with HW
	- Fix dma_from_device command in qdma_testapp application that requests more data from user logic than specified
	- Fix memory offset calculation in dma_from_device and dma_to_device command in qdma_testapp application for MM mode

2020.1 Updates
--------------
- Support DPDK v19.11 LTS
- Support QDMA4.0 context and register changes
- Common driver to support QDMA3.1 and QDMA4.0 designs
- Updated and validated the example design with marker changes for QDMA4.0 and without marker changes for QDMA3.1
- Added support for more than 256 functions 
- Support multiple bus numbers on single card

2020.1 Patch Updates
--------------------
- Resolved HW errors observed with QDMA4.0 MM only design
- Verified QDMA DPDK software with IOVA=VA mode by enabling hugepage allocation matching support in DPDK
  (i.e. by specifying the --match-allocations command-line switch to the EAL).

2020.2 Updates
--------------
- Added support for detailed register dump
- Added support for post processing HW error messages
- Added support for Debug mode and Internal only mode
- Resolved the issue related to mbuf packet length
- Fixed VF FMAP programming of qmax issue by setting qmax to the actual user configured total queue number

2020.2.1 Updates
----------------
- Migrated qdma dpdk driver to use DPDK framework v20.11

KNOWN ISSUES:
=============
- Function Level Reset(FLR) of PF device when VFs are attached to this PF results in mailbox communication failure
- DPDK C2H and Forwarding performance values for 8 queue is lesser compared to 4 queue case for both PF and VF.

DRIVER LIMITATIONS:
===================
- Big endian systems are not supported
- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
