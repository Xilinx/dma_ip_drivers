RELEASE: 2023.2.1
=================

This release is based on DPDK v20.11, v21.11 and v22.11 and
contains QDMA poll mode driver and QDMA test application.

This release is validated for
	- On VCU1525 for QDMA5.0 2022.1 example design
	- On VCU1525 for QDMA4.0 2020.2 example design
	- On VCU1525 for QDMA3.1 2019.2 example design
	- On XCVP1202 for CPM5 2022.1 example design
	- On XCVC1902 for CPM4 2022.1 example design

This release includes patch files for dpdk-pktgen v20.12.0 and v22.04.1 that extends
dpdk-pktgen application to handle packets with packet sizes more than 1518 bytes
and it disables the packet size classification logic in dpdk-pktgen to remove
application overhead in performance measurement.This patch is used for
performance testing with dpdk-pktgen application.

The driver is validated against dpdk-pktgen and testpmd applications for API compliance.

KNOWN ISSUE:
============
- CPM4:
	- HW pdi limitation
		- VF functionality with vfio-pci on host is not verified
		- VF functionality on VM is not verified
		- Forwarding performance numbers are not reaching 100Gbps and capping at 98.8Gbps

- CPM5:
	- Smaller packet forwarding performance optimizations are in progress and report will be updated in subsequent releases

- All Designs
	- Function Level Reset(FLR) of PF device when VFs are attached to this PF results in mailbox communication failure


DRIVER LIMITATIONS:
===================
- CPM5 Only
	- VF functionality is verified with 240 VF's as per CPM5 HW limitation

- All Designs
	- Big endian systems are not supported
	- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
