QDMA Software Features
**********************

* Polling and Interrupt Modes
	QDMA software provides 2 different drivers. PF driver for Physical functions and and VF driver for Virtual Functions.
	PF and VF drivers can be inserted in different modes.

   - Polling Mode 
		In Poll Mode, Software polls for the write back completions(Status Descriptor Write Back) 
		
   - Direct Interrupt Mode
		In Direct Interrupt mode, Each queue is assigned to one of the available interrupt vectors in a round robin fashion to service the requests. 
		Interrupt is raised by the HW upon receiving the completions and software reads the completion status.
		
   - Indirect Interrupt Mode
		In Indirect Interrupt mode or Interrupt Aggregation mode, each vector has an associated Interrupt Aggregation Ring. 
		The QID and status of queues requiring service are written into the Interrupt Aggregation Ring. 
		When a PCIe MSI-X interrupt is received by the Host, the software reads the Interrupt Aggregation Ring to determine which queue needs service. 
		Mapping of queues to vectors is programmable
		
   - Auto Mode
		Auto mode is mix of Poll and Interrupt Aggregation mode. Driver polls for the write back status updates.
		Interrupt aggregation is used for processing the completion ring.
		
- Allows only Privileged Physical Functions to program the contexts and registers

- Dynamic driver configuration
- Driver configuration through sysfs
- Asynchronous and Synchronous IO support
