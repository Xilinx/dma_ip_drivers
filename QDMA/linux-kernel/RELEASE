2020.1 Patch Updates
--------------------
- Resolved HW errors observed with QDMA4.0 MM only design
- Addressed VF performance issues.

2020.2 Updates
--------------
- Added support for detailed register dump

- Added support for Debug mode and Internal only mode
- Added support for Versal PDI programming through keyhole interface

2020.2 Patch Updates
--------------------

2022.1 Updates
--------------
CPM5
	- Tandem Boot support 
	- FMAP context dump
	- Debug register dump for ST and MM Errors
	- Dual Instance support

2022.1.1 Patch Updates
----------------------
- Ported changes from pull request https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers/pull/167 to fix XRT build issues while integrating qdma linux driver in to XRT stack

2022.1.2 Patch Updates
----------------------
- Added VF 4K queues support for CPM5 design. This feature is applicable only when corresponding RTL support is added.

2022.1.3 Patch Updates
----------------------
- Ported changes from pull request https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers/pull/170 to fix coverity issues

2022.1.4 Patch Updates
----------------------
- Added support for more than 2K queues for PF/VF
- Added support for Fedora36

KNOWN ISSUES:
=============
- CPM5 Only
	- Sufficient host memory is required to accommodate 4K queues. Tested only upto 2099 queues for PFs with our test environment though driver supports 4K queues.
	- VF 4K queue support is not fully verified due to pdi issues

- All Designs
	- In interrupt mode, Sometimes completions are not received when C2H PIDX updates are held for 64 descriptors
	- On QDMA4.0 2020.1 design, HW error observed during the probe of the VFs
	- With 2020.2 QDMA4.0 design, ST Performance design has performance drop for higher packet sizes

DRIVER LIMITATIONS:
===================
- CPM5 Only
	- VF functionality is verified with 240 VF's as per CPM5 HW limitation

- All Designs
	- Driver compilation on Fedora 28 with gcc8.1 results in compilation warnings
	- Big endian systems are not supported
	- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
	- FLR is not supported in the Driver for CentOS because linux kernels provided in CentOS versions does not support the driver call back registration for FLR functionality
