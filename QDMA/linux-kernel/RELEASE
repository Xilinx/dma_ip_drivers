KNOWN ISSUES:
=============
- CPM4 Only
	- Due to HW PDI limitaion,
		- VF is supported in poll mode only.
		- VF functionality on VM is not verfied.

- Observed MMAP failure for applications when device is binded QDMA Linux driver on Fedora37. Fix will be availbale in upcoming release.

- CPM5 Only
	- Performace optimizations are not finalized, Performance report with optimizations will be available in next patch release.

- All Designs
	- In interrupt mode, Sometimes completions are not received when C2H PIDX updates are held for 64 descriptors
	- On QDMA4.0 2020.1 design, HW error observed during the probe of the VFs

DRIVER LIMITATIONS:
===================
- CPM5 Only
	- VF functionality is verified with 240 VF's as per CPM5 HW limitation

- All Designs
	- Driver compilation on Fedora 28 with gcc8.1 results in compilation warnings
	- Big endian systems are not supported
	- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
	- FLR is not supported in the Driver for CentOS because linux kernels provided in CentOS versions does not support the driver call back registration for FLR functionality

- XRT Only
	- QDMA: Bypass user BAR check for XRT application
		- The existing driver code assmues the presence of the user BAR as indicated in the functional example design. If this user BAR is not detected during the driver probing process,
                  it results in a failure. However, this check is specific to example design and some customer designs might not contain user BAR. So bypassing the user BAR check to prevent
                  driver returning error and proceed further.
