- Interoperability between Linux driver (as PF/VF) and DPDK driver (as PF/VF)
- Driver restructuring to partition QDMA access code such that it can be used across different drivers

2019.2 Features
---------------
- Support for PF device removal when its VF devices are active
- Support for Interrupt moderation and adaptive counter threshold
- Support for configurable number of User and Data interrupts
- Added user logic pluggable interfaces for processing the descriptors and completions
- Added new interfaces for updating the Consumer Index and Producer Index

2020.1 Updates
--------------
- Modified the directory structure for driver source code.
- Application names are changed as "dma-ctl", "dma-perf", "dma-to-device", "dma-from-device"
- Support QDMA4.0 context and register changes
- Common driver to support QDMA3.1 and QDMA4.0 designs
- Support multiple bus numbers on single card

- Added support for more than 256 functions 
- Modified the driver interface to pass the module parameters for more than 256 functions
- Support for Function Level Reset (FLR) of both PFs and VFs.

2020.1 Patch Updates
--------------------
- Resolved HW errors observed with QDMA4.0 MM only design
- Addressed VF performance issues.

2020.2 Updates
--------------
- Added support for detailed register dump
- Added support for post processing HW error messages
- Added support for Debug mode and Internal only mode
- Added support for Versal PDI programming through keyhole interface

2020.2 Patch Updates
--------------------
- Added support for MM Channel Selection and Keyhole feature in dmaperf
- Fixed bug in in driver which caused crash during performance run

KNOWN ISSUES:
=============
- In interrupt mode, Sometimes completions are not received when C2H PIDX updates are held for 64 descriptors
- On QDMA4.0 2020.1 design onwards, HW error observed during the probe of the VFs
- With 2020.2 QDMA4.0 design, ST Performance design has performance drop for higher packet sizes

DRIVER LIMITATIONS:
===================
- Driver compilation on Fedora 28 with gcc8.1 results in compilation warnings
- Big endian systems are not supported
- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
- FLR is not supported in the Driver for CentOS because linux kernels provided in CentOS versions does not support the driver call back registration for FLR functionality
