RELEASE: 2019.2
===============

This release is validated on QDMA 2019.2 Patch based example design and QDMA 2019.1 based example design

SUPPORTED FEATURES:
===================
2018.2 Features
---------------
- Support for both the AXI4 Memory Mapped(MM) and AXI4 Streaming(ST) Interfaces
- 2048 Queue Sets
	- 2048 H2C Descriptor Rings
	- 2048 C2H Descriptor Rings
	- 2048 C2H Completion Rings
- Supports Polling Mode
- Interrupts
	- 2048 MSI-X Vectors
	- Up to 8 MSI-X per Function
	- Interrupt Aggregation
	- User Interrupts
	- Error Interrupts
- C2H Stream Completion queue entry coalescing
- Supports SR-IOV with up to 4 Physical Functions(PF) and 252 Virtual Functions(VF)
- Allows only Privileged/Physical functions to program the contexts and registers
- Function Level Reset(FLR) Support
- Mailbox Support
- Descriptor bypass(8, 16, 32 descriptor sizes)
- Descriptor Prefetching
- Asynchronous and Synchronous IO support
- ST H2C to C2H and C2H to H2C loopback support
- Driver configuration through sysfs
- Zero byte transfer support
- Dynamic queue configuration
- Dynamic driver configuration

2018.3 Features
---------------
- Auto mode support for PF & VF driver
	- MM and ST H2C requests are services in poll mode
	- ST C2H is services in Interrupt Aggregation mode
- Support 64B descriptor format in bypass mode
- Support for Completion queue descriptors of 64 bytes size
- Support flexible BAR mapping for QDMA configuration register space
- Indirect programming of FMAP registers
- Support disabling overflow check in completion ring
- Version for SW and HW
- ECC Support
- Flexible interrupt allocation between PF/VF
- Greater than 32 vectors per function
- Legacy Interrupt Support
- VF driver support in direct and indirect interrupt mode

2019.1 Features
---------------
- Interrupt support for Mailbox events
- Support Completions in Memory mapped mode
- Interoperability between Linux driver (as PF/VF) and DPDK driver (as PF/VF)
- Driver restructuring to partition QDMA access code such that it can be used across different drivers

2019.2 Features
---------------
- Support for PF device removal when its VF devices are active
- Support for Interrupt moderation and adaptive counter threshold
- Support for configurable number of User and Data interrupts
- Added user logic pluggable interfaces for processing the descriptors and completions
- Added new interfaces for updating the Consumer Index and Producer Index

KNOWN ISSUES:
=============
- Sometimes completions are not received when C2H PIDX updates are held for 64 descriptors
- Function Level Reset(FLR) of PF device when VFs are attached to this PF results in mailbox communication failure

DRIVER LIMITATIONS:
===================
- Driver compilation on Fedora 28 with gcc8.1 results in compilation warnings
- Big endian systems are not supported
- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
